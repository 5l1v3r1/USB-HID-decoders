redeagle@astzk.gov.hkn	Mission Successful!	General Red Eagle!
We have successfully deployed NotYepta and taken down major parts of Kolechia's infrastructure.
They will be an easy target now and we are almost ready for the physical attack.
In case the worm spreads to our internal networks through any communications channel from Kolechia, our data can be recovered with the decryption key DDC{f1l3_3ncryp710n_b3_G0NE}

We are ready to attack on your command!

GLORY TO ARSTOTZKA!
